Apache

Edit

sudo subl /etc/apache2/ports.conf 
and change the 80 on the following line to something different :

Listen 80
If you just change the port or add more ports here, you will likely also have to change the VirtualHost statement in

sudo subl /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/000-default.conf
and change the 80 on the following line to something different :

<VirtualHost *:80>
then restart by :

sudo service apache2 restart
---------------------------------------------

Nginx

Edit

/etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default
and change the 80 on the following line :

listen 80;
then restart by :

sudo service nginx restart
-------------------------------------------------
