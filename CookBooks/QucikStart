Install the Chef development kit: https://downloads.chef.io/chefdk/.

Generate a cookbook:

$ chef generate app first_cookbook
where first_cookbook is an arbitrary cookbook name.

Change into the first_cookbook directory.

Update the cookbooks/first_cookbook/recipes/default.rb recipe in the generated cookbook to contain:

file "#{ENV['HOME']}/test.txt" do
  content 'This file was created by Chef!'
end
Run the chef-client using the default.rb recipe:

$ chef-client --local-mode --override-runlist first_cookbook
This will create a file named test.txt at the home path on your machine. Open that file and it will say This file was created by Chef!.

Delete the file, run the chef-client again, and Chef will put the file back.
Change the string in the file, run the chef-client again, and Chef will make the string in the file the same as the string in the recipe.
Change the string in the recipe, run the chef-client again, and Chef will update that string to be the same as the one in the recipe.
